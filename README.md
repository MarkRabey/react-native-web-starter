# React Native Web Starter

> A very basic, somewhat opinionated, template for React Native Web

## Features

- Usage directly from [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Includes web support (the name probably gives that away)

## Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-web-starter
```

## Future Versions

A few things I'm considering adding to the template:

- GitHub Actions - this might be _too_ opinionated - then again, this is really more for me than anyone else.
- Redux - a lot of projects use Redux, but a lot don't. Maybe a separate template?
